# About Me

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Lightning Storms on Earth-like Exoplanets, for my final year Masters project.
- 🌱 I’m currently taking modules on about the fluid dynamics of accretion disks and the formation of planets from protoplanetary disks. In 2026 I'm looking forward to learning about global geophysics and seismology. 
- 👯 I’m looking for PhD opportunities in exoplanet atmospheric modelling, and/or extra-terrestrial atmospheric observations/modelling.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I love playing music and did a Diploma in music performance on the clarinet! One of my favourite pieces is Carl Maria von Weber's 1st Clarinet Concerto, especially Movement I: Allegro con fuoco (I promise it's actually good and classical music is NOT boring).
